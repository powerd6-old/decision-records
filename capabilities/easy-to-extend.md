# Easy to extend

## Creating custom content

Creating new content should be trivial for the people involved.

### Localizing custom content

Localizing custom content to different languages should be easy and transparent.

## Publishing custom content

Once custom content is created, publishing it as a new book or integrating it with the "core" rules should be easy for the publishers.

Legally, this should be simple and not require legal assistance to be completed.

### Using custom content with existing integrations

Once custom content is created, using it with existing integrations should be trivial.

Making new content appear in books, web pages and other integrations should be automated and painless.
