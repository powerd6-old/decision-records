# Easy to learn

## Reading the rules

Once the material is found, it must be readable.

### Accessibility

The material should be readable by everyone, regardless of their circumstances.

This means that multiple formats -file extensions and design/layout- should be easily available.

This also means that multiple languages should be available.

### Convenience

When applicable, the required material should be convenient to use.

Integrations, indexing, referencing and beyond are expected.

### Clarity

The available material should be clear and concise.

Intentions should be transparent and readers should be able to understand them with minimal external context or points of reference.

## Q&A

Questions can always be raised, and the community should be available to answer pertinent questions.
