# Standardize git usage

## Status

accepted

## Context

Having a standard on how to use git for collaboration helps with consistency.

## Decision

- A document should be created and shared detailing:
  - How to write commit messages
  - How to open and merge Pull Requests
  - How to use branches
- Repositories should be updated to reflect these procedures
  - Alternatively, an automated process might be created to enforce these settings

## Consequences

- A standard procedure that is well documented is available for any new contributor
- By adopting a standard the cognitive load for on-boarding will be reduced
