accepted

## Context

Before starting to work on the system, capabilities should be chosen so that the rest of the tasks can be aligned with them.

- New tags will be created to relate tasks with their capabilities

## Consequences

- Work tasks will be mapped to capabilities
- Roadmap planning will become more effective
