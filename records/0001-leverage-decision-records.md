# Leverage Decision Records

## Status

accepted

## Context

This is not the first time we've worked on a project with the potential to be long-running.

As such, there is potential that large decisions will need to be made early on that will have impacts in a far-away future. It is beneficial to keep records of thses decisions, with context inclued in them to help future readers understand what, why and how decisions came to fruition.

## Decision

- A new repository (this one) will be used to track decision records
- We will follow the [lightweight ADR template by Michael Nygard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md) to write these records

## Consequences

- Open-ended discussions will be reflected as decisions, solidifying their outcomes
- More documentation has to be produced to track decisions than the alternative (not documenting anything)
