## Organization

In order to keep the root of this repository clean and minimal:

- Agreements are placed in the `/agreements` directory
- Capabilities are placed in the `/capabilities` directory
- Records are placed in the `/records` directory

## Recording new decisions

Whenever a new decision is going to be made, a record should be created in this repository.

The format of the decision follows the [lightweight ADR template](https://adr.github.io/).

If you are unsure on where to start, look at any recent records and try to follow their format.
