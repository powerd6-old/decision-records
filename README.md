# decision-records

This repository stores decision records for the powerd6 project.

## Recording new decisions

Whenever a new decision is going to be made, a record should be created in this repository.

The format of the decision follows the [lightweight ADR template](https://adr.github.io/).

If you are unsure on where to start, look at any recent records and try to follow them.

## Organization

Records are placed in the `/records` directory, in order to keep the root of this repository clean and minimal.
